# WIREFRAME
This repository contains the wireframe for both app and web version of MeloFi .These wireframe will help you to visualise user flow, layout structure and will make it easy to plan 
interactions before adding detailed designs. I have made my wireframe in the figma application and have attached the links of the prototypes in this file.
